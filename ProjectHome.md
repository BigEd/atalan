Atalan is new high level experimental programming language for system programming. It is meant to be used for development on 8bit computers like Atari 800, C64, ZX Spectrum and other small (embedded) systems etc.

Compiler is rule driven and extremely retargetable. It is very easy to add support for new platform and it is possible to provide support for new CPU without touching the compiler source code. Programmers can easily provide support for new data types or operators.

Atalan is cross-platform development system. Compiler runs on desktop machine (Windows, Linux, OSX - it is developed just using ANSI C, so porting to other systems should be straightforward).
