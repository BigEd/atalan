Type inferencing
================

- self modification of attribute in loop should report error requesting 
  explicit declaration of that variable type
- self referencing (cannot define type - available in esieve)
- test assignment to non-existing variable
- warning hi from byte variable (explicitly defined)

===============
Error reporting
===============

- Report unexpected indent


- support constant expressions in enumerator definitions
- dead code elimination in parsing (conditional compilation)

- Records
  - type definition (just variable of TYPE_STRUCT with local variables - address of variable is offset of the variable regarding the structure base)
  - use MODE_ELEMENT as access to record field
  - type of the element is type of field (or last field)
	- combination with array 

- xor, or & and self (produces 0, self, 0)

x invalid array index detection
x assign type inferencing
x multiple return function assign type inferencing
x repeated assign inferencing (merge type - only for flexible types)
x var.min, var.max provides access to bounds

- linear transformation operator   a = RANDOM in 10..30

x for may parse expression at the beginning (variable name may be deduced)

- fix UNTIL x and y  (we must replace AND and OR in negated expressions)
- support default values for function arguments
x support  10 < x < 20

- support macro parameters in type parsing (%A, %B before array indices) and result type
  (only when parsing rule)
  
- loops with variable should test the bounds first

- for i until p(i) = 5

x in display_list, we do not use DLI, because it's a type (and we cannot evaluate type)

- support for bool (or 0..1 types)
- Rule should use parse block to parse code, TOKEN_INSTR should be part of parse code
- define assembler in platform file using ASSEMBLER constant

- platform:atari		- must be first assignment in file
		platform atari, c64, mc6502
		first think in the file (possibly after comments)
		platforms may nest (i.e. platform file may specify another platform)
		atari->mc6502
		-p may specify platform on command line
		default platform is ATARI :-)

In TETRIS
=========

- when tile drops with speed (force) make screen vibrate vertically

if x,y = 3,4 then

::::::::::::::::::::
	tile = 7
	while tile = 7
		tile = random and 7
::::::::::::::::::::::

x context of enum type for array (STRIG(0), STRIG(1))
x shift characters in font

::::::::::::::::::::::::::
draw'tile:proc
	tile:tile
	x:x
	y:y
=
	code of the procedure
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

- conditional expression

x = if a then 3 else 4

- loop expression

x = for i:0..10 where s(i) <> 0 (if s(i) = 3 return i)
 
- use of constant expressions in integer definitions 

- s(15..20, 7) = 5
   =>  for ?:15..20 ( s(?,7) = 5 )
   
x MODE_LABEL
x rules are hashed by instruction op 
- custom defined instructions should be built-in
    
x AND with const limits the type of resulting value (x & 0xff is 0..255, etc.)

- a() = 0, a = 0
- string initialized arrays
- a(..50)
- a(50..)
- array slices a(23..50) = 0
- dif slices a(23..+20) = 0
- a = 1,2,3  (repeat the vvalue or fill with zeroes, or keep rest untouched?)

- maybe we may have insert implemented?
   a(10..+1) = "ahoj"  -> insert 4 bytes instead of one
x   a(10) = "ahoj" 

- array assignment a(23) = sprite
- constant arrays (initialization)
- sqrt,sin,cos,... -> translation operators
 

x const %A:byte
- detect possibily to invert for loop
  Input or output registers musn't be accessed.
  (RANDOM is exception - it is input which does not require an order)
  
- detect possibility to increment loop variable so, that it ends with 0
  This means offseting arrays based on this variable.
  There cannot be aby other computation with the variable.

  
- shallow binding
		 
- check undefined labels (also we should specify type label when assigning it)

- prints on same line are not entered?
x "Hello"...	  does not make new-line

	
- platforms to www menu
- scope solving
- sophisticated error reporting
- type should be Var too 

==========
Generating
==========

- flags are represented as special registers with 0..1
- instruction may define implied results to flags
	let _a,0
	flag _z,0
	flag _n,0

    ifeq lbl, _z, 0
    ifeq lbl, _z, 1

	;labels in macros are indexed using macro invocation sequence number

	add %0:card, %0, 1   =
			add %0, %0, 1
			flag _z
			ifeq l1, _z, 0		; skip 1 instruction
			add %0(1), %0(1), 1
			label l1



;We need inc & dec to implement carry

	ADD _t, _c, %1 ADD _a, _a, _t  = adc %1 
	
	inc _a, _c, %1
	dec _a, _c, %1
	  
======
Arrays
======

- compute size
- two byte index
- multiple dimensions (up to 2)
x index tables (multidimensional array with 1st index byte - basically fastened multiplication)
- sliced arrays (structures, integers)


idx 	computed index (possibly by multiplication)

var1)
	letarr :byte, @, :card  

	clc
	lda #<arr
	add idx
	sta ptr
	lda #>arr
	add idx+1
	sta ptr+1
	ldy #0
	lda (ptr),y
	
var2) self-modifying code
	clc
	lda #<arr
	add idx
	sta ptr+1
	lda #>arr
	add idx+1
	sta ptr+2
ptr	lda $ffff

Documentation
=============

- Generate examples page
- Colorize
- Generate Index for reference

======================
Source code generation
======================

- lexer searches var table (so it can return TOKEN_VAR immediatelly)
- proc can be defined using instructions (only two arg, one result)
- range type (min..max), variable defines type

==============
Counted arrays
==============

Array can remeber number of elements it contains.
It is then possible to add items, get count and access top item. 

===================
Fixed point support
===================

Specify multiplier. Powers of 2 are very usefull due to it's efficiency, but any multiplier may be used.

seconds:0..65535*50

seconds = 3.5		;seconds = 175

Seconds are specified in ticks.

For time, it may be ticks.

Time is specified in seconds. It is then known, that is should be multiplied by 50, or 60 (depending
on whether the counter is PAL or NTSC).

Fraction support.

===================
table based parsing
===================

- macros defining operators

=====
IDEAS
=====

- instructions may be macros, arguments define number o arguments (and type - label)

============
6502 backend
============

x all conditional if's
x 16bit arithmetics
- constant array offset may be implemented as lda array+offset (even for big arrays!!)
- large arrays
- mul, div (byte, card)
- all card comparisons
- multiply, divide
x enums
- variable is referenced together with it's offset (offset is in bytes, or bits - as specified in struct)

- parse condition (for if, while, ...)
   - <x> | [not] <x> [= <> > < >= <=] <y> [and] [or]  
   - ( )
      
- rule may be special procedure with argument list and token list

  jmpeq dst, src, src

- relational operators (= <> > < >= <=)
x logical operators (not, and or)

- bit operations

- procedures declaration
- procedures call (no arg)
- procedures args
- structures
- arrays
	- short byte array
	
- optimizer
	- mutiply and divide using shift (*2, *4, *8, *16)
	- multi-rule matches
	- match variables (%2, %3, %4, ...)
	
- inline functions

- freevar token
- newvar  token

Unit Test
******************

- lo, hi
- array access & arithmetic etc.
		
******************
OPTIMIZE
******************

- optimize jumps
- optimize ldx #5 ldx #6  to ldx #5, inx
- multiply byte by 10 (use temporary _arr ?)
- optimize x + 0, y * 1,... (do it in eval const?)
- multiply byte by 3
x do not generate unnecessary labels (missile_size)

- when calling procedure, we may want to mark variables as used or not used based on
  current values (constants)
  

- optimize PROC parameter (and local variable?) usage

x Should replace let _a, _2000(0) with lo _a, set_col

    lo _a, cycle
    let VVBLKD(0), _a
    hi _a, cycle
    let VVBLKD(1), _a
    lo _a, set_col
    let _2000(0), _a
    hi _a, set_col
    let _2000(1), _a
    let _a, _2000(0)
    let VDSLST(0), _a
    let _a, _2000(1)
    let VDSLST(1), _a

- function inlining (function used only once automatically)
- Multiple prints should be joined together
