***************************************
Procedure arguments and local variables
***************************************

Procedure arguments and local variables are allocated as global variables.

When calling procedure, arguments are simply stored in appropriate variables and
procedure is called. On return, procedure results are loaded from output variables.

Atalan will assign same memory address to two or more procedure variables, 
if there is no conflict. (i.e. they do not call each other mutually).
Atalan will even use space for one big variable as space for multiple smaller variables
or try to merge space for multiple smaller variables to space for one bigger variable.

********************
2-dimensional arrays
********************

Atalan will create index of rows for 2-dimensional arrays, to provide fast access
to element x,y.
