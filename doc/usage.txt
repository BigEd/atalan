Atalan Compiler Usage
*********************

atalan.exe is command line utility. Specify name of source code to compile as 
an argument (source come nust have .atl extension, it is not necessary to specify it in argument). 
The compiler will generate file *.asm. If mads.exe is in the 
same directory as the compiler, *.asm is automatically compiled and
*.xex is produced.

You may specify following switches (each after minus):

- -v Verbose (will write lot of internal information on screen)
- -a Do not call assembler after compilation


For example to compile example stars.atl, type

::::::::::::::::::
atalan stars
::::::::::::::::::

atalan.asm and atalan.xex will be generated.
