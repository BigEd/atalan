Atalan
******

Atalan is new high level programming language for MOS Technology 6502 microprocessors.
It is meant to be used for development on 8bit computers like Atari 800,
C64 etc.

Atalan is work in progress, it can however already generate working code. In fact,
in most cases it generates excellent code.

Atalan is cross-platform development system. Compiler runs on desktop machine
(Windows, Linux, OSX - it is developed just using ANSI C, so porting to other 
systems should be straightforward).

It generates source code for 6502 assembler (MADS). It does not however use 
any special features, so other assemblers could be used too.

Language Features
=================

- structured programming (if then else, while, until)
- powerful loop construct (for k where sieve(k) = 1 until KEY = Q)
- procedures
- nested procedures
- functions with multiple return values
- macros
- numeric types defined using range (min..max)
- variables may be stored in user defined place
- blocks defined by parentheses, indent or one line
- enumerations
- local scope rules for constants
- type associated constants  (type hour:0..23 (noon = 12 midnight = 0))
- multidimensional arrays
- support for interrupts
- chained relational operators (10 < x <= 100)
- parametrized modules 
- type inferencing
- possibility to call assembler routines including definition of register arguments
