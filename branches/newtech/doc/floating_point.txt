=== Floating decimal point ===

We need to define mantissa size, exponent size and possibly base.

bcd: ±9999999999 × 10 ^ -64..63
single: ±16777215 × 2 ^ -128..127

We need to define a base for mantissa, so we know, how the accuracy is modified with operations. 

=== Solid decimal point ===

pos: 0..255 step 1÷2 

=== Use of plus/minus ===

10 ± 5   = 5..15
± 5 = 0 ± 5 = -5..5
a ± b   = a-b..a+b
